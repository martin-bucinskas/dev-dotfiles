# Development Environment Repository

This repository contains development environment configuration and setup
that I like to use day to day.

Consider this a cheatsheet for myself, along with a reference and an easy
setup for future.

## Dotfiles

All of the dotfiles are found under `/dotfiles` directory.

## Scripts

The `/scripts` directory contains various different scripts I use day to day, along any other
setup scripts required.
